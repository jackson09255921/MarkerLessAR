# MarkerLessAR
Using unity and vuforia to create the small project.

Welcome to my AR artwork.<br>
Since the previous version of directory is broken, there is only apk. file can work. Thus, I just put it on github.<br>
You are able to download the apk. file and transport to your own android phone.<br>
And then, make your camera focus on speticular platform. You will see a block.<br>
Without hesitation! Just click it! A minions will appear in your world.<br>
 
The following is a sample. It's awesome, right?.<br>
Fially, I hope that you have a good time to enjoy it~.<br>
